# Installing elfshaker

## Using pre-built binaries
1. Grab the latest `elfshaker-Release-[arch].tar.gz` from [Releases](https://github.com/elfshaker/elfshaker/releases).

2. Extract to any location you would like and add the directory to your path:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/opt && mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && tar -xf "elfshaker_v0.9.0_$(uname -m)-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz" -C ~/.local/opt && ln -s ~/.local/opt/elfshaker/elfshaker ~/.local/bin/elfshaker
```

mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
tar -xf "elfshaker_v0.9.0_$(uname -m)-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz" -C ~/.local/opt
ln -s ~/.local/opt/elfshaker/elfshaker ~/.local/bin/elfshaker
```
</details>

**Please, make sure to add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH environment variable.**
